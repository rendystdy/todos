# React Native Skeleton

This project is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) skeleton that can be used to kickstart a mobile application.

The skeleton provides **an optimized architecture for building solid cross-platform mobile applications** through separation of concerns between the UI and business logic.

## Requirements

Node 12 or greater is required. Development for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode 10 or up, and will target iOS 11 and up.

You also need to install the dependencies required by React Native.  
Go to the [React Native environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), then select `React Native CLI Quickstart` tab.  
Follow instructions for your given `development OS` and `target OS`.

## Quick start

To running project simply run :

```
git clone https://github.com/rendystdy/todos.git
```

Assuming you have all the requirements installed, you can run the project by running:

- `yarn install` to install all depedencies
- `cd ios && pod install` to install all depedencies
- `yarn <platform>` to run the *platform* application (remember to start a simulator or connect a device)
